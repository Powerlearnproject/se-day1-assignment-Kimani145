#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with the development of software solutions within certain constraints and requirements. 
The discipline is important in the technology idustry. First because it aims to improve the industry by providing autometed tasks hence reducing redundancy and saving on costs and resources. Second because it provides a way to integrate tasks within different environments making it possible to create advanced tech solutions.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Gatherig: Well define the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.
Design: Create well outlined designs of the software organization and user interface
Imolementation: Write code based on the design specifications.
Testing: Chose a good approach to test the program
Maintainance: Continuosly maintain the software system to ensure it continues to deliver its job and achieve all the objectives.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile Methodology is implemented when user input is required for the software development process to go to the next phase. It is adaptable to different user requirements and testing is continuoslly done. Waterfall methodology focuses on a set of requirements provided at first, then the system is developed and testing is done afterwards. No user input is required to design the system. Testing is only done after development is completed.
We can use Agile methodology in designing a software for a dynamic field like healthcare industry and waterfall methodology for a field like archive management where certain standards must be followed.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software developer writes code and implemnts softwares.
A quality assurance manager ensures the software being developed meets the required quality by regulary testing it.
A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An IDE is a software that developers use to write, debug and test applications. e.g., Anaconda Navigator, VS Code
Version Control System (VCS) is a software that tracks changes to source code and coordinates of team activities, e.g., Git 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

New requirements: Occurs when the initial requirements change. Effective communication and agile methodologies are solutions to this.
Cost: Occurs when funds are not properly managed. Solution is prioritizing tasks based on what hey demand.
Time constraints: The task can be overwheming, especially when you are multitasking. It's solutions include adapting agile methodologies e.g scrum and prioritizing tasks.
Ensuring code quality: In large codebases, the task can be difficult to maintain. To solve this, one might do code reviews, automated testing or even refactoring.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing refers to testing individual components in the software. It ensures all units are functioning.
Integration: Tests the interaction between different components. Ensures each component is communicating with the other one effectively.
System testing: Tests the entire system as a whole.
Acceptance testing: Tests the software functionality against the requirements and user expectations. It ensures the system meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering deals with constructing clear and consise prompts for an AI model in order to get the best response. It is important as the user enters clear prompts and the AI model is able to provide a good response. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Bad prompt: What seasons do we have?
Good prompt: Explain the different wearher seasons we have in Kenya.
The first prompt gives the AI model a hard time trying to figure out what type of season the user wants to know. In the second prompt, the AI model can narrow done its answer and provide a response that is informative and answers the user's question.
